In the code, we have used three types of sorting algorithm. Which are bubble sort,
improved bubble sort and selection sort. 
In bubbleSort function, we went through all the adjacent values and check if the first
one is greater than the second one. If yes, then we swapped them. For this algorithm
we get a time complexity of n^2 (worst case scenerio).
The second funcion is the Improved bubble sort. Where we checked if the array is already
sorted at some point, if it is sorted then we broke the main loop. So this algorithm 
takes less time than the original one.
Lastly, we applied selection sort, which is much faster than bubble sort. In this case,
we took the full array and got the minimum value and swapped it with the first index. 
Then we took the sub-array from second index to last and swapped the minimum with the 
second index and so on. 
Among the three sorting algorithms, selection sort is faster.
